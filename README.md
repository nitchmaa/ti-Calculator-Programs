# ti-Calculator-Programs

This program was written to help me check my answers quickly while taking exams in a machine design course.
Solving for principal stresses and principal directions can be done through long formulas but a quick and 
easy abstraction for solving these stresses and directions by hand is the use of Mohr's circle.  This program 
is meant to be used in conjunction with the hand analysis to check answers as you go and hopefully avoid any mistakes.
