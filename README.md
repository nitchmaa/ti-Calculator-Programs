# ti-Calculator-Programs
This repository is a collection of programs that I used on my TI-84 C during my undergrad studies in mechanical engineering.  I would use these programs during exams to double check my work as I would go and hopefully avoid having to spend much time erasing and doing the same calculations twice.  


MOHRS2:
This program was written to help me check my answers quickly while taking exams in a machine design course.
Solving for principal stresses and principal directions can be done through long formulas but a quick and 
easy abstraction for solving these stresses and directions by hand is the use of Mohr's circle.  This program 
is meant to be used in conjunction with the hand analysis to check answers as you go and hopefully avoid any mistakes.
